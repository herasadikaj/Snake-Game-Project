# XML QUIZ

'''

This Python program is designed to load quiz questions from an XML file, present them to the user, 
collect their answers, and then evaluate the user's score based on the correctness of their responses.

Code Structure:

The code starts with a <questions> tag that encapsulates all the quiz questions. 
Within <questions>, each <question> tag represents an individual question. 
Inside each <question>, there is a <text> tag for the question text, <options> tag 
for answer choices, and <correct> tag for the correct answer.

The code consists of two main functions:

	1. load_questions(filename): This function loads quiz questions from the XML file.
      It parses the XML structure, extracts question details, options, and correct answers, 
      and stores them in a list.
	2. run_quiz(questions): This function runs the quiz based on the loaded questions. 
    It iterates through each question, presents it to the user along with options, 
    collects the user's answer, checks its correctness, and updates the user's score accordingly.
